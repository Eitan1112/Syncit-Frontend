            The video file is being trimmed to small sections and only those sections are being sent to the server.
            The server analyzes the video and subtitles to determine the delay, and finally you get a synced subtitles file.

            It usually take 2-3 about minutes. <br />
            However, it can take longer if there are a lot of background noises or poor audio quality. Anyway, there is a progress bar to keep track and make sure nothing got stuck.
