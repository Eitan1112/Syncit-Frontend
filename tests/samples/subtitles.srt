00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,622
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,669
Losing a brother, the massive
hole that leaves in your life.

3
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,307
Like the same massive hole

4
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:25,357
losing a husband makes.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,807
- Your brother's dead, Lincoln.
- How do you explain that?

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,779
- Lincoln Burrows.
- Jacob.

7
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:31,682
- Uncle Lincoln!
- Hey!

8
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:33,985
911. I have an armed
intruder in my house.

9
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:35,922
We've awoken something...

10
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:38,000
Something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

11
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,844
- I don't know who we're fighting.
- Let's go to Yemen and find out.

12
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:42,306
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.

13
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,794
I'll find someone who does.

14
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,830
The country's falling apart.
Everyone wants out.

15
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:48,615
Welcome to the civil war.

16
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:50,919
Come quickly, or we'll all be dead!

17
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:53,701
- Who's that contact again?
- A woman named Sheba.

18
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:54,927
Michael's caught in the
middle of something big.

19
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,929
Kaniel Outis is

20
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:57,541
- a big-time terrorist.
- We've arranged

21
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,232
a visit to Ogygia Prison.

22
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:00,669
That mean Michael's in there?

23
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,600
Michael?

24
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,448
My name isn't Michael, and
I don't know who you are.

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,283
_

26
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:08,419
Michael, what are you doing, damn it?!

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,581
The fighting in Yemen intensified today

28
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,204
as ISIL forces get ever
nearer to the capitol.

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,560
The rebels, who have the
stated intent of taking over

30
00:01:16,562 --> 00:01:19,290
the country and establishing
a radical caliphate,

31
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,965
are also bent on freeing their leader,

32
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:24,502
Abu Ramal, who was captured by
the government five years ago.

33
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:27,771
Ramal is known for his
extreme views and practices,

34
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:30,400
from using young girls as sex slaves,

35
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:33,430
to a medieval brand of justice
that includes public beheadings

36
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:34,678
and executions in the street.

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,614
Ramal is currently being held in Yemen's

38
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:39,399
most notorious
penitentiary, Ogygia Prison.

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,195
_

40
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:08,817
Psst.

41
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:13,553
This is it.

42
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:18,589
Whip, get up here.

43
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:20,891
Is it happening?
